# module-4-project

1. Some challenges I ran into were setting up my Vercel website and integrating my API into Python.
2. I learned more about what APIs were and how they can integrate into Python. I also learned how to parse the outcome of JSON code.
3. I created backlog items to integrate user input into the program and to integrate a secondary API with a similar function.
4. Because the vercel website is being hosted on a public IP address while the one running on the VM is running directly on the localhost's loopback address.
